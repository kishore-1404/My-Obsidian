## Today's Questions

### Aptitude Question 1
- **Topic**: Time and Work
- **Source**: IndiaBix
- **Difficulty**: Medium

#### Question
```
A can do a piece of work in 10 days and B can do the same work in 15 days. They started working together but after 2 days, B left the job. In how many more days will A finish the remaining work?
```

#### My Solution
- Work done in 2 days by both A and B = 2 × (1/10 + 1/15) = 2 × (3+2)/30 = 2 × 5/30 = 10/30 = 1/3
- Remaining work = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3
- A can do 1/10 of work in a day
- So, A will complete remaining work in = 2/3 ÷ 1/10 = 2/3 × 10 = 20/3 = 6⅔ days ≈ 7 days (rounding up)

#### Correct Solution & Explanation
- Work done in 2 days by both = 2 × (1/10 + 1/15) = 2 × (3+2)/30 = 2 × 5/30 = 10/30 = 1/3
- Remaining work = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3
- A's 1 day's work = 1/10
- Time taken by A to complete remaining work = 2/3 ÷ (1/10) = 2/3 × 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 days ≈ 7 days

#### Formula/Concept Used
- If A can do a work in 'a' days and B can do the same work in 'b' days:
  - A's 1 day's work = 1/a
  - B's 1 day's work = 1/b
  - Combined 1 day's work = 1/a + 1/b
- To find days to complete work: Days = Work remaining ÷ Work done per day

### Aptitude Question 2
- **Topic**: Time and Work
- **Source**: GeeksforGeeks
- **Difficulty**: Medium

#### Question
```
A, B and C can complete a work in 20, 30 and 60 days respectively. They all work together for 3 days, after which C leaves. How many more days will A and B take to complete the remaining work?
```

#### My Solution
- Work done by A in one day = 1/20
- Work done by B in one day = 1/30
- Work done by C in one day = 1/60
- Total work done in 3 days by all three = 3 × (1/20 + 1/30 + 1/60) = 3 × (3+2+1)/60 = 3 × 6/60 = 18/60 = 3/10
- Remaining work = 1 - 3/10 = 7/10
- Work done by A and B together in one day = 1/20 + 1/30 = (3+2)/60 = 5/60 = 1/12
- Days required to complete remaining work = 7/10 ÷ 1/12 = 7/10 × 12 = 84/10 = 8.4 days ≈ 9 days (rounding up)

#### Correct Solution & Explanation
- Work done per day: A = 1/20, B = 1/30, C = 1/60
- Combined work per day = 1/20 + 1/30 + 1/60 = (3+2+1)/60 = 6/60 = 1/10
- Work done in 3 days = 3 × 1/10 = 3/10
- Remaining work = 1 - 3/10 = 7/10
- Work done by A and B per day = 1/20 + 1/30 = (3+2)/60 = 5/60 = 1/12
- Days required = 7/10 ÷ 1/12 = 7/10 × 12 = 84/10 = 8.4 days ≈ 9 days

#### Formula/Concept Used
- Combined work rate formula: 1/T = 1/T₁ + 1/T₂ + 1/T₃ + ...
- Work done = Time × Rate
- Remaining work = Total work - Work done
- Time to complete = Work ÷ Rate

## Today's Puzzles

### Puzzle 1
- **Type**: Logical Reasoning
- **Source**: Puzzles for Placement
- **Difficulty**: Medium

#### Problem
```
There are 3 boxes: one contains only apples, one contains only oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges. The boxes are labeled "Apples", "Oranges", and "Apples and Oranges", but each box is labeled incorrectly. You're allowed to pick one fruit from one box without looking inside. How can you label all boxes correctly?
```

#### My Approach
- Since all boxes are labeled incorrectly, I should pick a fruit from the box labeled "Apples and Oranges"
- If I get an apple, this box contains only apples
- If I get an orange, this box contains only oranges
- After identifying this box, I can determine the others by logical deduction

#### Solution
- Pick a fruit from the box labeled "Apples and Oranges"
- If it's an apple, this box contains only apples
  - The box labeled "Apples" must contain only oranges (since labels are wrong)
  - The box labeled "Oranges" must contain both fruits
- If it's an orange, this box contains only oranges
  - The box labeled "Apples" must contain both fruits (since labels are wrong)
  - The box labeled "Oranges" must contain only apples

#### Key Insights
- The key insight is that all boxes are labeled incorrectly, which gives us enough information to solve the puzzle with just one observation
- Logical deduction can be used to solve the rest once one box is identified
