# Placement Preparation - 2025-05-19

## Topics Studied Today

### Topic 1
- **Subject**: HashMap Implementation
- **Resources Used**: GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode articles
- **Duration**: 1.5 hours

#### Key Concepts Learned
- Hash function design and requirements (uniformity, efficiency)
- Collision resolution techniques (chaining, open addressing)
- Load factor and resizing operations
- Time complexity analysis for different operations

#### Important Points
- A good hash function should distribute keys uniformly
- Load factor = n/k (n = number of entries, k = number of buckets)
- When load factor exceeds threshold (typically 0.75), resize the hash table
- Chaining uses linked lists at each index to handle collisions
- Open addressing uses probing techniques (linear, quadratic, double hashing)

#### Practice Questions
- Implement a HashMap from scratch
- LeetCode: Design HashSet
- LeetCode: Design HashMap
- Implement LRU Cache using HashMap

### Topic 2
- **Subject**: Big O Notation
- **Resources Used**: MIT OpenCourseWare, Cracking the Coding Interview
- **Duration**: 1 hour

#### Key Concepts Learned
- Asymptotic analysis and notation (O, Ω, Θ)
- Best, worst, and average case analysis
- Space complexity vs time complexity
- Amortized analysis for data structures

#### Important Points
- O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(2ⁿ) < O(n!)
- When analyzing recursive algorithms, recurrence relations are useful
- Space complexity includes both auxiliary space and input space
- Drop constants and lower order terms in Big O notation
- Consider all input parameters that can affect runtime

#### Practice Questions
- Analyze time complexity of common sorting algorithms
- Determine space complexity of recursive vs iterative solutions
- Optimize a brute force solution to a more efficient algorithm
- Compare different solutions based on Big O analysis

## Interview Preparation

### Technical Interview
- **Topics Practiced**: Array algorithms, HashMap operations
- **Mock Interview**: No
- **Duration**: 45 minutes

#### Questions Practiced
- "Tell me about a time when you had to optimize code for performance"
- "Explain how hash tables work internally"
- "What are the trade-offs between using an array vs a hash table?"

#### Areas to Improve
- Need to practice speaking more clearly when explaining technical concepts
- Create a more structured approach when analyzing algorithm complexity
- Practice writing code on whiteboard or without IDE assistance

### HR/Behavioral Interview
- **Questions Prepared**: "Tell me about yourself"
- **Mock Interview**: No
- **Duration**: 30 minutes

#### Responses Practiced
- Prepared a 2-minute introduction that highlights:
  - Educational background in computer science
  - Technical skills and programming languages
  - Project experiences
  - Career goals and interest in the company
- Structured using the Past-Present-Future format

#### Feedback Received
- None yet, will seek feedback from peers tomorrow
