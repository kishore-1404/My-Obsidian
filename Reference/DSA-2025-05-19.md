## Today's Problems

### Problem 1
- **Problem Name**: Two Sum
- **Source**: LeetCode
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Problem Type**: Arrays, Hashing
- **Link**: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

#### Problem Description
```
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

#### My Approach
- Use a hash map to store values and their indices
- For each element, check if (target - current element) exists in the hash map
- If it exists, return the current index and the index from the hash map
- Otherwise, add the current element and its index to the hash map

#### Solution Code
```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    # Create a hash map to store values and their indices
    hash_map = {}
    
    # Iterate through the array
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Calculate the complement
        complement = target - num
        
        # Check if the complement exists in the hash map
        if complement in hash_map:
            # Return the indices
            return [hash_map[complement], i]
        
        # Add the current element and its index to the hash map
        hash_map[num] = i
    
    # No solution found
    return []
```

#### Time Complexity
- O(n) - we traverse the array once

#### Space Complexity
- O(n) - in worst case, we store all elements in the hash map

#### Key Insights & Learnings
- Hash maps provide O(1) lookups which is ideal for this problem
- The one-pass solution is more efficient than the two-pass solution
- This is a classic example of trading space for time

### Problem 2
- **Problem Name**: Valid Parentheses
- **Source**: LeetCode
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Problem Type**: Stack
- **Link**: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/

#### Problem Description
```
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

#### My Approach
- Use a stack data structure
- Push opening brackets onto the stack
- When encountering a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty or the top element doesn't match
- If either condition is true, return false
- Otherwise, pop the top element and continue
- At the end, check if the stack is empty

#### Solution Code
```python
def isValid(s):
    # Create a stack
    stack = []
    
    # Define the mapping of closing brackets to opening brackets
    mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    # Iterate through the string
    for char in s:
        # If the character is a closing bracket
        if char in mapping:
            # Pop the top element if the stack is not empty, otherwise assign a dummy value
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
            
            # Check if the mapping is correct
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:
            # Push the opening bracket onto the stack
            stack.append(char)
    
    # The string is valid if the stack is empty
    return not stack
```

#### Time Complexity
- O(n) - we traverse the string once

#### Space Complexity
- O(n) - in worst case, we store all characters in the stack

#### Key Insights & Learnings
- Stack is the perfect data structure for this kind of matching problem
- Using a hash map for the bracket pairs makes the code cleaner
- Edge cases to consider: empty string, odd-length string, etc.
