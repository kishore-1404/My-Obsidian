## Important Formulas and Shortcuts

### Time and Work
- If A can do a work in x days, then A's 1 day's work = 1/x
- If A can do a work in x days and B can do the same work in y days, then working together they can finish the work in (xy)/(x+y) days
- If A is x times as efficient as B, then (A's time):(B's time) = 1:x

### Time, Speed and Distance
- Time = Distance/Speed
- Average Speed = Total Distance/Total Time
- For upstream and downstream problems: Speed upstream = (Speed in still water - Speed of stream), Speed downstream = (Speed in still water + Speed of stream)

### Percentages
- Percentage change = (Final value - Initial value) × 100 / Initial value
- Successive percentage changes: If there are successive percentage changes of x% and y%, the net percentage change is: x + y + (xy/100)

### Profit and Loss
- Profit or Loss Percentage = (Profit or Loss × 100) / Cost Price
- Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit = Cost Price - Loss
- If an article is sold at a profit of x%, then (SP/CP) = (100 + x)/100
- If an article is sold at a loss of x%, then (SP/CP) = (100 - x)/100

### Simple and Compound Interest
- Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100
- Amount = Principal + Interest
- Compound Interest = Principal × [(1 + Rate/100)^Time - 1]
